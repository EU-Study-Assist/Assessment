EU Assessment.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the running app.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Nunito](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## My Approach:

I ensure to follow the common coding principles DRY - (Do not Repeat Yourself) and KISS - (keep It Simple Stupid) by making my components reuesable and also keeping them simple.

## Challenges I Faced

One of the assessment page has no mobile view, so I had to think of a simple and good UI all by myself, No resource was added to the assessment repo readme file which made me go searching for the perfect resource (Icon, Image etc) to use.
